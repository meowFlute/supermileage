****NOTES ON PED FILE FORMAT****
-The fuel table starts at BYTE 186 and ends at BYTE 1485
-Each number is represented by a 16 bit something, that something seems to be scaleable, but no matter what only 8 bits are used....?
-From what I can tell, it is an 8 bit number that is just distributed as evenly as possible over the range you choose
-The range for our car is 0.01 - 4.00, which means we are distributing 256 bits over 400 possible locations

- This means that 1 bit = 0.015625 in decimal for our particular map (confirmed)
- zero doesn't make sense, so 0x00 actually represents 0.015625 (which seems to be rounded)
- They go column by column, not row by row. There are 25 columns of 26 rows. making for 650 BYTES 
that for some reason are stored in 16 bits each with a byte of trailing zeros. 1300 BYTES of data to read
discarding every other byte and then adding one and scaling the byte by 0.015625.
